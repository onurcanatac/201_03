# FlowerLibrary
As a homework of my CS201 class, I implemented a software tool which can be used to share flower knowledge, learn
more about flowers, and find flower names from their features. I made a flower
library to achieve this and used the linked list data structure for the
implementation. The flower library has the following functionalities:

- Add a flower
- Remove a flower
- Show the list of flowers
- Show the features of a flower
- Add a new feature to flower
- Remove a feature from a flower
- Find all flowers with a feature
